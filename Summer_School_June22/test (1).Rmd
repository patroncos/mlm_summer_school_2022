#.center[Multilevel models for binary response]

The multilevel linear model is generally appropriate when the outcome is continuous and
normally distributed

--

Other type of data do not satisfy the assumption of normality: Count data, categorical data, ordinal data, etc. 

--

Just as in the well-known single level models, we use logistic regression in multilevel modeling when the outcome variable is binary (Yes/No)

---
class: middle

## Examples

--

- Whether someone reoffend or not

--

- Whether someone was victim of a crime or not

--

- Intention to vote in the next elections


---
##  Logistic regression (Recap)

Asume we want to analyse employment pattern in a sample of people

We have binary variable $Y$ indicating employoment status where:
 - 1 = employed
 - 0 = unemployed

We can use linear regression as many of the assumption for linear regression are not satisfied
- Values are bounded by 0 and 1 
- We can't assume normality 


We model the probability that $y = 1$ (i.e. employed)

$$Pr(y_i=1) = p_i$$

---
class: middle

## Logistic regression (Recap)


We use a logistic or **logit** transformation of the outcome to *link* the dependant variable to a set of explanatory variables

$$logit(p_i)=\log\left(\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\right)$$
We can write the model:
$$logit(p_i)=\log\left(\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\right) =  \beta_0+\beta_1x_{i}$$


The logit link function keep values in a range between 0 and 1

- This is necessary as probabilities must be between 0 and 1

- We can write the equation in terms of odds:

$$\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}} =  \exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i})$$

## Two level random intercept model for binary response

Using the same example, imagine that we now have an additional variable indicating local authorities where respondents live

Consider a two-level structure where $n$ individuals $i$ are nested within groups $J$
- Group can be any level two unit (school, cities, etc.)

.pull-left[

$$\log\left(\frac{p_{ij}}{1-p_{ij}}\right)  = \beta_0+\beta_1x_{ij}+u_j$$
<br>
<br>
where
<br>
<br>
$$u_j \sim N(0,\sigma^2_u)$$

]

.pull-right[

The left side is the nonlinear transformation (log odd)

the right side take the form of a linear model

<br>

The group effect or level two residuals $u_j$ are assumed to be independent and follow a normal distribution

## Interpretation of main parameters

--
$\beta_0$ is the *overall intercept*
--

- $\beta_0$ is the log-odds that $y=1$ when $x=0$ and $u=0$

--

$\beta_1$ is usually referred as *cluster-specific* effect

--

- $\beta_1$ is the effect of a 1-unit chage in $x$ in the log-odds that $y=1$, while adjusting for group effect $u$

--

$u_j$ is the *group random effect* or level two residual

--

- $\beta_0 + u_j$ is the intercept for a given group $j$

--

- $var(u_j) = \sigma_u^2$ is the between-group variance and represent the variability across groups


---
class: middle
## Variance Partition Coefficient (VPC)

Measures the proportion of the total variance that is due to differences between groups

--

There a several ways of defining VPC for binary data:
- Model linearization
- Simulation
- .bold[<font color="#314152">Latent Variable approach</font>]

###VPC  Latent Variable Approach
Recall VPC formula for continuous response:
$$VPC = \frac{\sigma_u^2}{\sigma_u^2 + \sigma_e^2}$$

Assume that the underlying response variable is *continuous* but we can only observe a **binary response** indicating whether the underlying variable is greater or less than a given threshold.

This underlying continuous variable come from a logistic distribution with a variance of $\frac{\pi^2}{3} \approx 3.29$

Replacing on the previus formula:

$$VPC = \frac{\sigma_u^2}{\sigma_u^2 + \sigma_e^2*}$$  
where $\sigma_e^2*= \frac{\pi^2}{3}$

## Example

### Antenatal care in Bangladesh

We want to analyse whether a woman received antenatal care from a medically-trained provider at least once before her most recent live birth. 

We also want to explore whether antenatal care **varies across communities**


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

var <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-mora/MLM_summer-school/main/data/variables_names.csv") 
knitr::kable(var, format = "html")
```

There are level 1 variable (individual level)  and level 2 variables (area level).
- antemed: Outcome 
- comm: Level 2 identifier
---

```{r eval=TRUE}
mydata <- read.table("data/antenatal.txt",  
                     header = TRUE, sep = ",")

```

class: middle

##R output
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
fit <- glmer(antemed ~    # Outcome variable
             (1 | comm),  # level two specification
             family = binomial("logit"),  ##link function #<< 
             data = mydata)

```

###**Fixed part**


```
Fixed effects:
            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)  
*(Intercept)  0.14809    0.07178   2.063   0.0391 *
---
Signif. codes:  
0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

```

###**Interpretation**

The log-odds of receiving antenatal care in an ‘average’ community $(u_j=0)$ is estimated as $\beta_0=0.148$.

---
class: middle

## R Output (2)

###**Random part**
```
Random effects:
 Groups Name        Variance Std.Dev.
 *comm   (Intercept) 1.464    1.21    
Number of obs: 5366, groups:  comm, 361
```
###**Interpretation**

The intercept for community $j$ is $0.148+u_j$, where the variance of $u_j$ is estimated as $\sigma^2_u=1.464$

## Adding explanatory variables
```{r eval=TRUE}
mydata <- read.table("data/antenatal.txt",  
                     header = TRUE, sep = ",")

fit2 <- glmer(antemed ~ magec + (1 | comm), family = binomial("logit"), data = mydata)
```

###**We add maternal age (level 1 predictor)**
 
```
Fixed effects:
             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
*(Intercept)  0.144604   0.071781   2.015    0.044 *  
*magec       -0.032357   0.005235  -6.181 6.37e-10 ***
---
Signif. codes:  
0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```
```{r eval=TRUE}
mydata <- read.table("data/antenatal.txt",  
                     header = TRUE, sep = ",")

fit3 <- glmer(antemed ~ magec + urban + (1 | comm), family = binomial("logit"), data = mydata)
```

<br>

###**We add Urban (level 2 predictor)**

```
Fixed effects:
             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
(Intercept) -0.346247   0.074256  -4.663 3.12e-06 ***
magec       -0.032481   0.005221  -6.221 4.94e-10 ***
